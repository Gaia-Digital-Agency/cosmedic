  - [x] `docs/brand-guidelines.pdf` (moved from /brand.pdf)
  - [x] `docs/pricelist.xlsx` (moved from /procedure.xlsx)
  - [x] Reorg: `uploads/` → `discovery/{feedback,roadmap,screenshots,source-imagery}`
  - [x] Reorg: design source + `assets/` → `design/`
  - [x] Initial commits pushed to `origin/main` on GitHub
  - [x] Base 3PRTVN install (root `package.json` + `pnpm install`) — pre-Phase-1

- [x] **PHASE 1 — Monorepo scaffold + Cosmedic CMS branding**
  - [x] Postgres `cosmedic` role + db provisioned (local 127.0.0.1:5432)
  - [x] `pnpm-workspace.yaml` + `packages/cms` (Payload 3.84.1 on Next 15.4.11, port 4007) + `packages/web` (Vite SSR + Express, port 3007)
  - [x] `ecosystem.config.cjs` for pm2 (`cosmedic-cms` + `cosmedic-web`)
  - [x] `.env` + `.env.example` (DATABASE_URI, PAYLOAD_SECRET, PORT vars, bootstrap admin)
  - [x] Cosmedic CMS admin branding: `CosmedicBeforeLogin.tsx`, `CosmedicLogo.tsx` (no-op), `CosmedicIcon.tsx`, `admin-theme.css` (brand palette + Cormorant Garamond + JetBrains Mono)
  - [x] Brand palette + typography wired into admin
  - [x] `theme: 'all'` (light/dark toggle)
  - [x] Hello-world boot — both processes online, `/admin` shows the Cosmedic CMS login (verified 200)
  - [x] Initial Payload migration generated + applied (`src/migrations/20260520_112358.ts`)
  - [x] Bootstrap super-admin seeded from `.env` (super_admin@email.com) — auth verified, JWT issued
  - [x] Smoke: `curl localhost:3007` → 200 + "BIMC CosMedic"; `curl localhost:4007/admin` → 200; sibling sites untouched (christos / templategen / templatebase / flowstep all still online)
  - [x] `docs/site_features.md` written (site walkthrough + features inventory)

  - [x] Mega-menu hover bridge (2 s scheduled close + bridge padding) preserved from design
  - [x] EN | ID switcher state in header (stubbed — locale routing arrives Phase 9)
  - [x] Seed data ported (`TREATMENT_LIST`, `SUBCATEGORIES_BY_DISCIPLINE`, `SURGEON_LIST`, `WHATSAPP_HREF`) → `src/content/seed.ts`
  - [x] Brand assets `design/assets/logo*.png` copied to `packages/web/public/assets/`

  - [ ] Visual regression baseline (Playwright) — deferred to Phase 11 alongside the full QA gate
  - [ ] Tailwind theme mapping — deferred (CSS-vars + class names from `globals.css` are already the source of truth; Tailwind layer will be added only if/when needed)

- [x] **PHASE 3 — Homepage**

  - [x] LeadMagnet (Bali Recovery Guide cover + email-capture form + success state)
  - [x] Journey (5 steps: Consult · Plan · Arrive · Procedure · Recover)
  - [x] Stories (3 testimonials with verified-review chips + portraits)
  - [x] Place (Bali recovery copy + A/B/C/D list + recovery-stays CTA)
  - [x] HomeApp wired in `App.tsx` — `<PageShell>` wraps all 11 sections
  - [x] Build verified: 51 modules, 72 kB CSS bundle, 238 kB JS bundle (gzip 12 kB + 74 kB)
  - [x] All home section classNames present in SSR markup (`hero-v2`, `trust-strip`, `intro`, `treatments`, `price-teaser`, `surgeons`, `gallery`, `lead-magnet`, `journey`, `stories`, `place`)

## 47 Pages — CMS page-record checklist (Phase 6)

Each row is one CMS-managed page record. The "Source" column shows which collection creates it. Tick when the seed script creates the record AND the public route renders it from Payload (no longer from `seed.ts`).

### Top-level pages (15) — Pages collection
