## Phases

- [x] **PHASE 0 — Documentation + git checkpoint**
  - [x] Project root: `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.gitignore`, `.claude/`
  - [x] `docs/architecture_info.md`, `file_structure.md`, `db_schema.md`, `db_ops.md`, `cms_info.md`, `cms_ops.md`, `cms_schema.md`, `sitemap.md`, `plan.md`, `todo.md`
  - [x] `docs/brand-guidelines.pdf` (moved from /brand.pdf)
  - [x] `docs/pricelist.xlsx` (moved from /procedure.xlsx)
  - [x] Reorg: `uploads/` → `discovery/{feedback,roadmap,screenshots,source-imagery}`
  - [x] Reorg: design source + `assets/` → `design/`
  - [x] Initial commits pushed to `origin/main` on GitHub
  - [x] Base 3PRTVN install (root `package.json` + `pnpm install`) — pre-Phase-1

- [x] **PHASE 1 — Monorepo scaffold + Cosmedic CMS branding**
  - [x] Postgres `cosmedic` role + db provisioned (local 127.0.0.1:5432)
  - [x] `pnpm-workspace.yaml` + `packages/cms` (Payload 3.84.1 on Next 15.4.11, port 4007) + `packages/web` (Vite SSR + Express, port 3007)
  - [x] `ecosystem.config.cjs` for pm2 (`cosmedic-cms` + `cosmedic-web`)
  - [x] `.env` + `.env.example` (DATABASE_URI, PAYLOAD_SECRET, PORT vars, bootstrap admin)
  - [x] Cosmedic CMS admin branding: `CosmedicBeforeLogin.tsx`, `CosmedicLogo.tsx` (no-op), `CosmedicIcon.tsx`, `admin-theme.css` (brand palette + Cormorant Garamond + JetBrains Mono)
  - [x] Brand palette + typography wired into admin
  - [x] `theme: 'all'` (light/dark toggle)
  - [x] Hello-world boot — both processes online, `/admin` shows the Cosmedic CMS login (verified 200)
  - [x] Initial Payload migration generated + applied (`src/migrations/20260520_112358.ts`)
  - [x] Bootstrap super-admin seeded from `.env` (super_admin@email.com) — auth verified, JWT issued
  - [x] Smoke: `curl localhost:3007` → 200 + "BIMC CosMedic"; `curl localhost:4007/admin` → 200; sibling sites untouched (christos / templategen / templatebase / flowstep all still online)
  - [x] `docs/site_features.md` written (site walkthrough + features inventory)

- [x] **PHASE 2 — Theme + PageShell**
  - [x] Port `global.css` (3,687 lines) verbatim → `packages/web/src/styles/globals.css`
  - [x] Google Fonts loaded (Cormorant Garamond + Inter + JetBrains Mono) via `<link>` in index.html
  - [x] Primitives: `Btn`, `Mono`, `Eyebrow`, `Img` (with painted-SVG fallback), `Reveal` (IntersectionObserver), `PriceTag` (IDR + AUD), `ChapterOpener`, `TrustBar`, `CTABandSlim`
  - [x] Shell: `Header` (mega-menu hover bridge, EN|ID switcher, scroll-state, mobile drawer), `Footer` (3 link columns + newsletter), `FloatingChrome` (fixed CTA + WhatsApp fab), `PageShell` composer
  - [x] Mega-menu hover bridge (2 s scheduled close + bridge padding) preserved from design
  - [x] EN | ID switcher state in header (stubbed — locale routing arrives Phase 9)
  - [x] Seed data ported (`TREATMENT_LIST`, `SUBCATEGORIES_BY_DISCIPLINE`, `SURGEON_LIST`, `WHATSAPP_HREF`) → `src/content/seed.ts`
  - [x] Brand assets `design/assets/logo*.png` copied to `packages/web/public/assets/`
  - [x] Pricing helper `src/lib/pricing.ts` (AUD↔IDR @ 10,500, rounded to 50k IDR)

  - [ ] Visual regression baseline (Playwright) — deferred to Phase 11 alongside the full QA gate

  - [ ] End-to-end test: submit → admin sees record + email arrives

- [ ] **PHASE 8 — nginx + SSL + DNS + deploy**
  - [ ] DNS A record: `cosmedic.gaiada.online` → `34.124.244.233`
  - [ ] nginx server block (port 80, then 443 after certbot)

## 47 Pages — CMS page-record checklist (Phase 6)

Each row is one CMS-managed page record. The "Source" column shows which collection creates it. Tick when the seed script creates the record AND the public route renders it from Payload (no longer from `seed.ts`).

### Top-level pages (15) — Pages collection

| # | Route | Page record (Pages.slug) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `/` | `home` | [ ] |
| 2 | `/treatments` | `treatments` | [ ] |
| 3 | `/surgeons` | `surgeons` | [ ] |
| 4 | `/journey` | `journey` | [ ] |
